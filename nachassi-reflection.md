* Prior to the GPS session I was less familiar with pulling, merging, and fetching from github.  Thankfully John was able to explain and give examples of the differences.

* Like previously stated: pulling, mergin, and fetching from and to github. 

* During the GPS I asked several questions relating to commands: What is the proper syntax for different git commands? What is the difference between git pull and fetch?

* I'm not confused about any of the git topics, I just need practice.

* My first experience with a GPS was great.  My partner Mark was very nice and easy to work with and John was a great guide that helped us whenever we were stuck on a problem.
